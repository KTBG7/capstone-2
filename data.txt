March 30th, 1974 3:00 AM CST. Larry Wheels wakes up to chilling scream. Larry jumps off his bed and quickly looks out the window. The street pitch black with no one in sight.
Larry thinks he must've just had a nightmare and leaves the window. As he's about to lay back down he hears another scream, it sounded closer and he could tell it was a woman.
Larry begins to think, 'Should I "help" her or go back to "sleep" since I have a project due tomorrow?

Help
Larry quickly puts on clothes and shoes and runs out of his house. He looks around to see if he can see them better now but still nothing. He then hears scream to his left, but this scream ringed in his ear. It was filled with pain and fear. Larrys decides to head towards the scream when he suddenly sees a man run across the street to the right. Larry is conflicted on whether he should go help the woman to his "left" or go after that shady man on his "right".

Left
Larry sprints towards the the scream and with every step he could accurately discern where she was. When Larry got to her, he sees the woman laying in a pool of blood on her side. She had been stripped of all clothes and was brutally stabbed. Larry is stuck deciding whether he should "grab" her and help her or "call" 911 first.

Grab
Larry decides to grab her and while turning her to get her in a more comfortable position, he accidentally grabs the knife that she was stabbed with. The knife had still been in her since she knew that taking it out would only speed up her bleeding. Because of Larry, she begins to bleed much quicker. Larry becomes scared and as he begins to call 911, she ends up bleeding out. Larry decides whether or not he should continue to "call" or just "leave" her.

Call
Larry turns on his phone and realizes that it's now 5 AM. Larry calls 911 quickly and then leaves to get some rest before his project.
Larry wakes up to his alarm and immediately starts remembering the what happened. He checks the clock and realizes that he has to get ready for his project. When he finishes getting ready he realizes that there's only 30 minutes until he has to present. He doesn't have enough gas to go to work so he would have to get pump some on the way to work. Should Larry "drive" or take "public" transport?

Public
Larry goes to the train station and gets on the train. Right before the doors close, a man runs onto the train. He stands at the end of the cart and looks eyes for a second with Larry. The man looks alarmed and moves onto the next cart. Larry finds it suspicious, should he "follow" or "stay"?
