March 30th, 1974 3:00 AM CST. Larry Wheels wakes up to chilling scream. Larry jumps off his bed and quickly looks out the window. The street pitch black with no one in sight.
Larry thinks he must've just had a nightmare and leaves the window. As he's about to lay back down he hears another scream, it sounded closer and he could tell it was a woman.
Larry begins to think, 'Should I "help" her or go back to "sleep" since I have a project due tomorrow?

Help
Larry quickly puts on clothes and shoes and runs out of his house. He looks around to see if he can see them better now but still nothing. He then hears scream to his left, but this scream ringed in his ear. It was filled with pain and fear. Larrys decides to head towards the scream when he suddenly sees a man run across the street to the right. Larry is conflicted on whether he should go help the woman to his "left" or go after that shady man on his "right".
