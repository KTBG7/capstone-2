March 30th, 1974 3:00 AM CST. Larry Wheels wakes up to chilling scream. Larry jumps off his bed and quickly looks out the window. The street pitch black with no one in sight.
Larry thinks he must've just had a nightmare and leaves the window. As he's about to lay back down he hears another scream, it sounded closer and he could tell it was a woman.
Larry begins to think, 'Should I "help" her or go back to "sleep" since I have a project due tomorrow?

Larrys decides to head towards the scream when he suddenly sees a man run across the street to the right. Larry is conflicted on whether he should go help the woman to his "left" or go after that shady man on his "right".

Larry sets up the appointment with the Detective to tell him what he knows about the murder. He gets to the Detective's office and begins to explain, 'Hello, I was at my house when I heard a scream, I tried to see what was happening but there was no one in sight and it was really dark.' The Detective responds, 'Well that's interesting, you're the only one who has given me any type of feedback, are you sure you didn't see anything, you're a perfect match for a potential suspect, I'd like to put you on trial.' The moment he says that, two cops walk into the room and cuff Larry.

The Trial begins and there's not much evidence other than unfortunate timing. They ask him if he's seen anything. Should he "Explain" the man he saw or "Deny" it?

Larry lies about not hearing anything on his street. He explains how he slept with music on which is probably why he didn't hear the murder on his street. The Detective doesn't buy this lie and puts him in cuffs for lying. Once in trial, the Jury didn't take him lying lightly and they found the knife on his front porch which leads them to choose Death Row, Death by hanging.
