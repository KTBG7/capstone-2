Bedroom
It's 3:00 AM and 'Larry Wheels' wakes up to the sound of a woman screaming for help. Larry rapidly puts on clothes and looks out the window. Larry hears another scream but he can't see what's going on.

Larry looks at his bedroom door conflicted. Larry has a presentation to make
at 9:00 AM for TEKsystems. Should Larry try to "help" the woman or "sleep"?

The corridor has led to a dark room. The moment you step inside, the door

There is no escaping. Type "quit" to die.

Killer
Larry sprints after the shadowy figure and runs into an alley. Larry looks down the alley but sees no one. Larry walks down towards the end of the alley. As Larry walks past a dumpster, the Killer puts Larry into a lock with a knife against his throat. The Killer says, 
'You shouldn't have tried to play the hero' and slits his throat.

You died.
