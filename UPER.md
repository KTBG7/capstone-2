*I will then have to plan all the possible outcomes or scenarios I want to implement into the game to make the more exciting.
*I will reduce the players choice to only 2 per scenario but I want to add a go back functionality to go to their last choice if they messed up or regret their choice or restart to start from the beginning.
*I want to be able to have a file most likely text file that will just
