Object Oriented Programming Concept Questions

As you should know by now, there are 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming.

********************
1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the wrapping of variables and the methods as a single unit. The variables are hidden from the rest of the classes and can only be accessed through the current class. This specific method needs getters and setters to manipulate the private data. 
One example of this would be making a Person class with a private String name, idNum and age. To give and change values of the variables in any instances of Person, we set getters and setters on the Person class which we need to call to populate those variables.
********************
2. Inheritance
Inheritance is where a class is able to inherit fields and methods from a parent class. The class whose features are inherited is usually known as the Super class. The sub class is the class that inherets from the super. Reusability is another concept that is included in inheritance, when you need to create a new class that uses some of the same feautures of another class, you can just inherit from it to make it more efficient by just inheriting the methods and fields instead of recreating them everytime.
********************
3. Abstraction
Abstraction is the practice where any non-essential information is not shown to the user. A great example of this is a Car, you don't see the car parts i.e the engine, instead you see the car itself. It can also be seen as a process in which you identify the required characteristics instead of also including the non-essentials. Another Example is if someone is using a computer and playing a game, they know that the computer renders the images when they click on something but they don't know specifically how but that is not necessary to play the game.
********************
4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is where a parent class can reference a child class object. Polymorphism, in more friendly terms, has a IS-A relationship. For example, Kevin is a human. An iPhone is a phone. An S20 is a phone. Another example, we could have a class Animal with method diet(){Sysout("Eats food")}. If we made a Human class, we can @Override the diet method to Sysout("Eats meat and plants, they're omnivores) so that it fits the correct description for the human since the Animal class is generic.


Please write a 1-3 paragraphs explaining these 4 concepts further.  Please provide a sufficient enough explanation about these pillars, as well as some examples to illustrate the practical use cases of these principles.
